          <p class="para">
            Dedication is the answer to almost all problems in life. Dedication
            has many different meanings. But all of them indicate at a sole
            devotion to something in life. When you love something, you want to
            do anything for it under any condition and without any regret, this
            is called dedication. For example, you love to build flower garden.
            Now, you will need several things for that to happen. You will have
            to give time and work very hard being dedicated. After all, your
            sole purpose is to build a garden with many beautiful plants. So,
            the time you give and the hard work you give with consistency will
            be called your dedication.

          <h1 class="h1">Devotion</h1>
          <p class="para">
            “Devotion to god with intense faith, sincerity and love” is the
            simplest way and how to cultivate it is described almost elaborately
            in the Gita, in which innumerable episodes are added to demonstrate
            god’s merciful qualities. The acharyas, who were deputed by god with
            a mission to guide the earning souls, have brought out the esoteric
            significance of the Divine actions. The significance of events like
            Lord Krishna’s sport with innocent cowherd maiden has been explained
            in Madhawa’s commentary. People refer to a doubt whether the path
            adopted by the cowherd maiden can be emulated by all, the Acharya
            writes that the Lord nothing to benefit from any of such sports. The
            maids were soaked in devotion and the Lord knows the trajectory,
            rich a soul has to take. The desire of the women served as a
            catalytic -or to further intensify their bhakti, transforming them
            totally oblivious all mundane considerations.

          <h1 class="h1">Knowledge</h1>
          <p class="para">
            The proverb “Knowledge is Power” states that knowledge is the most
            powerful weapon one can have. In fact, it is so powerful that it can
            change the complete course of human civilization. All around us we
            see the manifestation of knowledge that humans have gained since
            ages. It is like a wealth that is continuously augmented and
            transferred from one generation to another. Knowledge is essential
            for living. Not only humans but also animals are seen displaying
            knowledgeable behavior in their everyday life. It is only the
            knowledge about Mother Nature and other animals that helps a deer
            identify warning calls and avoid running into a predator. This is
            not only an example of wisdom gained through knowledge but also a
            perfect example that knowledge is the most powerful weapon to save
            lives.
