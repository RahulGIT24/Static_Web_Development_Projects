            <h1>Treadmill</h1>
            <p>
              A treadmill is a device generally used for walking, running, or
              climbing while staying in the same place. Treadmills were
              introduced before the development of powered machines to harness
              the power of animals or humans to do work, often a type of mill
              operated by a person or animal treading the steps of a treadwheel
              to grind grain. In later times, treadmills were used as punishment
              devices for people sentenced to hard labor in prisons. The terms
              treadmill and treadwheel were used interchangeably for the power
              and punishment mechanisms. More recently, treadmills have instead
              been used as exercise machines for running or walking in one
              place. Rather than the user powering a mill, the device provides a
              moving platform with a wide conveyor belt driven by an electric
              motor or a flywheel. The belt moves to the rear, requiring the
              user to walk or run at a speed matching the belt. The rate at
              which the belt moves is the rate of walking or running. Thus, the
              speed of running may be controlled and measured. The more
              expensive, heavy-duty versions are motor-driven (usually by an
              electric motor). The simpler, lighter, and less expensive versions
              passively resist the motion, moving only when walkers push the
              belt with their feet. The latter are known as manual treadmills.

            <h1>Dumbbells</h1>
            <p>
              The dumbbell, a type of free weight, is a piece of equipment used
              in weight training.It can be used individually or in pairs, with
              one in each hand. Adjustable dumbbells consist of a metal bar
              whose centre portion is often engraved with a crosshatch pattern
              (knurling) to improve grip. Weight plates are slid onto the outer
              portions of the dumbbell and secured with clips or collars. Shown
              to the right is a "spinlock" dumbbell, whose ends are threaded to
              accept large nuts as collars. Alternatively, a dumbbell may have
              smooth ends with plates being secured by a sprung collar.

            <h1>Excercise Ball</h1>
            <p>
              An exercise ball is a ball constructed of soft elastic, typically
              in 5 diameters of 10-centimeter increments, from 35 centimeters
              (14 inches) to 85 centimeters (34 inches), and filled with air.
              The air pressure is changed by removing a valve stem and either
              filling with air or letting the ball deflate. It is most often
              used in physical therapy, athletic training and exercise. It can
              also be used for weight training. The ball is also known by
              various other names, for instance: balance ball, birth ball, body
              ball, fitness ball, gym ball, gymnastic ball, physio ball, pilates
              ball, Pezzi ball, stability ball, Swedish ball, Swiss ball,
              therapy ball, or yoga ball.

            <h1>Decline Bench Press</h1>
            <p>
              The bench press, or chest press, is an upper-body weight training
              exercise in which the trainee presses a weight upwards while lying
              on a weight training bench. The exercise uses the pectoralis
              major, the anterior deltoids, and the triceps, among other
              stabilizing muscles. A barbell is generally used to hold the
              weight, but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.[1] The barbell
              bench press is one of three lifts in the sport of powerlifting
              alongside the deadlift and squat, and is the only lift in the
              sport of Paralympic powerlifting. It is also used extensively in
              weight training, bodybuilding, and other types of training to
              develop the chest muscles. Bench press strength is important in
              combat sports as it tightly correlates to punching power. Bench
              press can also help contact athletes increase their performance
              because it can increase effective mass and functional hypertrophy
              of the upper body
